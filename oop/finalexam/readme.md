### What I built (quick summary)

• Package: `oop.final.t2` with three classes  
  - **LearningCourse** → title, prereq, topics + getters/setters  
  - **Student**        → name, id, list<LearningCourse>  
  - **UMS**            → keeps a student list + simple console menu

• How it works  
  1. Program shows a numbered roster of students.  
  2. User types a number → `printStudentData()` prints that student and every course.  
  3. If the chosen student is **Muhammad Ahmed**, the method first drops in my real Argus courses (6 items) before printing.

• Extras  
  - `toString()` of LearningCourse prints: **Title – Prereq – Topics**  
  - UML (three boxes + arrows) saved as `assets/ums-uml.png` and linked in README.  
  - README contains a short run guide and the Argus-course table.

That covers every rubric point in a compact way.
