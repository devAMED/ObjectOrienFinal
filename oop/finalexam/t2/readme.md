What I built (quick summary)

• Package: oop.finalexam.t2 with three classes

LearningCourse → title, prereq, topics + getters/setters
Student → name, id, list
UMS → keeps a student list + simple console menu
• How it works

Program shows a numbered roster of students.
User types a number → printStudentData() prints that student and every course.
If the chosen student is Muhammad Ahmed, the method first drops in my real Argus courses (6 items) before printing.
• Extras

toString() of LearningCourse prints: Title – Prereq – Topics
UML (three boxes + arrows) saved as assets/ums-uml.png and linked in README.
README contains a short run guide and the Argus-course table.
That covers every rubric point in a compact way.
